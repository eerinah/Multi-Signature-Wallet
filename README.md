# Multi-Signature Wallet 
A smart contract that acts as a wallet by allowing any user to deposit funds in Ether, Ethereum's native token, into it. The smart contract allows users to define certain ethereum addresses as owners of the wallet. Only owners of the wallet may withdraw funds from the wallet or transfer funds of the wallet to another address. However, these functions can only be executed with the consent of all the owners of the wallet.

## Motivation 
To practice writing smart contracts in Solidity using inheritance and functions that allow for funds to be deposited into them.
